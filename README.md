# Extract earthquake data from wikipedia
First import pandas. 
Also import the Wikipedia module. 
The 'get_earthquake_data' function takes one argument 'Name'. This would be the name of the desired earthquake.
The page() function extracts all the data on the web page.
Th read_html function, offered by pandas, converts the tabular data into dataframes.
Change the indices to the first row labels.
Export the data into an excel sheet.
